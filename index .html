        <p>Since we have started tracking the gender pay gap, the difference between the earnings of women and men has shrunk, but only by an incremental amount each year. There remains a disparity in how men and women are paid, even when all compensable factors are controlled, meaning that women are still being paid less than men due to no attributable reason other than gender. As our data will show, the gender pay gap is wider for women of color, women at higher job levels, and women in certain occupations and industries.</p>

        <p>Our research shows that the uncontrolled gender pay gap, or opportunity pay gap, which takes the ratio of the median earnings of women to men without controlling for various compensable factors, has decreased by $0.08 since 2015. In 2021, women make only $0.82 for every dollar a man makes, which is one cent more than they made in 2020. However, this improvement could be attributable to lower paid women leaving the workforce due to layoffs or family care. The opportunity pay gap measures the barriers women face in attaining the higher paying positions of power that men often hold in society.</p>
